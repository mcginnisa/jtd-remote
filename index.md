# Overview

This is the website for a Sonoma State University Senior Design Project. This is a robotics focused project which aims to autonomously land and recharge a small quadcopter with machine vision.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) are gaining popularity due to their agility and ease of manufacture. However, due to battery life limitations, longer autonomous flight patterns are not feasible for most of these vehicles. There is an imminent need among researchers and industry engineers alike to develop UAV systems capable of supporting autonomous recharging routines for a variety of applications. Our proposed solution to this problem is the creation of a robotic duo, consisting of a UAV and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), which will support autonomous landing and recharging of the UAV on top of the UGV platform. The UGV uses an on-board camera and CPU to accomplish image recognition of the UAV, thereby enabling the UGV to maneuver itself (and crucially, the charging platform) underneath the UAV prior initiating the landing routine. The landing routine also supports small adjustments of the UAVâ€™s descent by the UGV as needed to maintain an ideal landing.
