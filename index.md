# Overview

This is the official website for the Sonoma State University Autonomous Landing and Recharging of  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Project

Completely autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems have colossal potential to solve modern problems in novel ways. Industry professionals and public institutions alike are actively researching the potential of these vehicle systems to perform a variety of automated tasks, such as field surveillance, search-and-rescue operations, and, notably, parcel delivery. Digital systems have eliminated the need for hand-delivered postal messages, and soon they could eliminate the need for hand-delivered packages all together. A large share of conventional vehicles may potentially be retired from our public roads by substituting them with cargo drones capable of performing similar or greater levels of economic activity, thereby saving lives, reducing CO2 emissions, and decongesting roads.
Unfortunately, as with any aircraft, the most difficult and dangerous parts of their utilization are take-off and landing routines. Additionally, battery life limitations among more budget-friendly UAV options typically make longer flight routines impractical or unfeasible. A solution is therefore needed to accomplish the autonomous landing, recharging, and flight routine resumption for such a UAV system. For more sophisticated unmanned systems involving a combination of aerial and ground vehicles (such as those currently being developed for parcel delivery and/or surveying tasks), such control schemes must handle the coordination of multiple vehicles with varying degrees of mobility. The solution proposed by this project seeks to tackle the most challenging problem of autonomous and unmanned aircraft missions in an accessible and generalizable way.
